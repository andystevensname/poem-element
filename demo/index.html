I CELEBRATE myself, and sing myself,
And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

I loafe and invite my soul,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.

My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, 
this air,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their 
parents the same,
I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
Hoping to cease not till death.

Creeds and schools in abeyance,
Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,
I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
Nature without check with original energy.

<poem-element line-numbers wrap-lines>
This is a very long line with no apparent need to stop so it just keeps going and going and going and going, and so it will wrap.
This is a short line.

This line begins a new stanza.
This is another short line.
This is a very long line with no apparent need to stop so it just keeps going and going and going and going, and so it will wrap.
